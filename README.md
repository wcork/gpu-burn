# gpu-burn

This is me playing around with Rust / Cuda bindings using the
[cudarc](https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc) crate. It's highly inspired by
an older [C/C++ project](https://github.com/wilicc/gpu-burn) of the same name.

I intent to use this project as a baseline for integrating `ptx` kernels from
`cu` kernels or others into my other projects.
